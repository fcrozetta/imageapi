# imageapi

A simple image API used in Tech Art classes. It includes:

* A Vector3 class
* Color conversion functions (toRGB, hsvToRGB, etc)
* Image unary and binary filters (filter, hsvFilter)
* Image convolution
* Histogram and accumulated histogram calculation

The codes are educational, so performance is NOT a factor taken into account. Also, the code is based on static 
functions and a few lambdas, not in object oriented programming.

It also contains a bunch of Activities files, with exercises.
